# Markowitz_Portfolio_Implementation
The implementation is currently incomplete. The current implementation can only support calcualting weighting between two stocks (instead of multiple stocks).
The data used is from Quantopian.

The finding root (solving the efficient frontier method) is taken from https://blog.quantopian.com/markowitz-portfolio-optimization-2/.
